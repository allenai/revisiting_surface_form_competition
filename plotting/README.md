`compare_independent_variables.py` produces Figures 5, 11, 12, 13 for a given dataset `--dataset {openbookqa, commonsense_qa, mmlu}`. This script assumes you have run `main.py` for all combinations of prompt (`no_answer_choices`, `string_answer_choices`, `enumerated_answer_choices`) and model (`google-flan-t5-xxl`, `curie`, `davinci`, `davinci-instruct-beta`, `text-davinci-003`, `facebook-opt-30b`) with seed `10` (both the regular and `--uncontextual_premise` versions), and that the appropriate csv and log output files exist in `./data/`. The script will produce a plot for each model and save them in `./plotting/independent_var_plots/`.

`make_line_graphs.py` produces Figures 3, 9, and 10. This script assumes you have run `main.py` for all combinations of prompt (`no_answer_choices`, `string_answer_choices`, `enumerated_answer_choices`), model (`google-flan-t5-xxl`, `curie`, `davinci`, `davinci-instruct-beta`, `text-davinci-003`, `facebook-opt-30b`), dataset (`openbookqa`, `commonsense_qa`, `mmlu`), and # shots (0, 1, 2, 4, 8) with seed `10`, as well as seeds `20` and `30` for `curie`, `davinci`, and `davinci-instruct-beta` at 1, 2, 4, and 8 shots. It assumes that the appropriate csv and log output files exist in `./data/`. The script will produce a plot for each model and save them in `./plotting/line_plots/`.

`correlation_plots.py` produces Figures 4 and 7 for a given dataset `--dataset {openbookqa, commonsense_qa, mmlu}` and number of in-context examples `--num-primes {all_shot 0, 1, 2, 4, 8}` (`all_shot` is plotted in the paper). It also prints the statistics for Table 1. This script assumes you have run `main.py` for all combinations of prompt (`no_answer_choices`, `string_answer_choices`, `enumerated_answer_choices`) for each model (`google-flan-t5-xxl`, `curie`, `davinci`, `davinci-instruct-beta`, `text-davinci-003`, `facebook-opt-30b`) for a specified dataset and number of in-context examples, and that the appropriate csv and log output files exist in `./data/`. The script will produce a plot for each model and save them in `./plotting/scatterplots/`.

Figures 1, 6 and 8 were produced by Jupyter notebooks that can be provided on request.
